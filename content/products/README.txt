Product Content Structure

Purpose:
- One folder per product.
- Keep product text and product photos together.
- Use the same format so content can be reused for site pages.

How to add a new product:
1. Copy `content/products/_template` to `content/products/<product-slug>`.
2. Rename `<product-slug>` to something simple, lowercase, hyphenated.
   Example: `s13-digital-cluster`
3. Edit `product.txt` with your real specs, price, and features.
4. Upload photos into the `photos` folder.

Photo naming:
- hero.jpg (main product photo)
- detail-01.jpg
- detail-02.jpg
- install-01.jpg

Supported photo formats:
- .jpg
- .jpeg
- .png
- .webp

Current example:
- `content/products/example-cluster/product.txt`
- `content/products/example-cluster/photos/`
